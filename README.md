# Fine-tuned Text Summarization Model

### Introduction
In this project, we will fine-tune a pre-trained language model for the task of text summarization. Text summarization is the process of creating a concise and accurate summary of a given text while preserving its essential information. Specifically, we fine-tune a pre-trained T5 model for text summarization using the Prefix-Tuning technique on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Our advise is to modify the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to potentially improve the model's performance.

### Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning Techniques
While traditional fine-tuning updates all the trainable parameters of the pre-trained model, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques aim to further reduce the number of trainable parameters, leading to even greater computational efficiency and potential for better generalization.

### Prefix Tuning
Prefix Tuning introduces a small number of trainable "prefix" vectors that are prepended to the input sequence before passing it through the pre-trained model. These prefix vectors are learned during fine-tuning, while the pre-trained model weights remain frozen. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, making it more efficient and potentially less prone to overfitting.

### Prompt Tuning
Prompt Tuning is similar to Prefix Tuning but operates on the input prompts instead of the input sequence itself. A small set of trainable vectors, called soft prompts, are learned and prepended to the input prompt during fine-tuning. This technique can be particularly effective for few-shot learning scenarios where only a few examples are available for fine-tuning.

### Adaptor Modules
Adaptor Modules introduce small, trainable neural networks (called adaptors) between the layers of the pre-trained model. During fine-tuning, only the adaptor modules are trained, while the pre-trained model weights remain frozen. This approach allows for efficient adaptation of the model to the target task while preserving the pre-trained knowledge.
These parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques offer several advantages over traditional fine-tuning, including:
1. Reduced Computational Cost: By training only a small subset of parameters, these techniques require significantly less computational resources, making them more scalable and accessible.
2. Better Generalization: By preserving the majority of the pre-trained weights, these techniques may be less prone to overfitting and better able to generalize to unseen data.
3. Flexibility: These techniques can be applied to various pre-trained models and tasks, providing a flexible and efficient approach to fine-tuning.

In summary, fine-tuning LLMs, especially with parameter-efficient techniques, allows for efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to specific tasks, leveraging the knowledge and patterns learned during pre-training while specializing for the target domain or task.
